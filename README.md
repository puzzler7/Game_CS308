This project implements the game of Breakout.

Name: 

### Timeline

Start Date: 1/15/20

Finish Date: 1/20/20

Hours Spent: Approximately 14 hours, although I didn't really keep track.

### Resources Used
I used the the [official Java documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/) extensively. Additionally,
I used these free sprites from [OpenGameArts](https://opengameart.org/content/breakout-brick-breaker-tile-set-free).


### Running the Program

Main class: breakout.Main

Data files needed: Everything in data and levels

Key/Mouse inputs: Move your mouse to move the paddle.

Cheat keys:
- L: Add a life.
- R: Reset ball position. Paddle position does not reset, as it is tied to the mouse position.
- Numbers: Jump to the corresponding level.
- -/_: Decrease the game speed, decreasing score gains. This caps at 1/10th of normal speed.
- =/+: Increase the game speed, increasing score gains. This caps at 5 times normal speed.

Known Bugs:

Extra credit: It seems that I've failed to find the extra credit, despite my searching.


### Notes/Assumptions


### Impressions
I would have loved to spend time to make the game *feel* good, like making the paddle and bouncers bounce slightly on
hit, or have particle effects on brick destruction, but I didn't have the time.

Additionally, my initial plan is an absolutely monstrous list of tasks. I must have been incredibly overconfident when I
wrote that, because while I *could* implement most of the list without too much refactoring, I don't have the time.
